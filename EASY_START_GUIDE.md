# üöÄ Easy Start Guide - Metatron V2.3

This guide will help you quickly get started with the Metatron V2.3 system using the one-command approach.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system
2. **Git** (to clone the repository)
3. **Internet connection** (for downloading dependencies)

## üöÄ Quick Start - One Command Launch

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RealDaniG/MetatronV2-Open-A.G.I-.git
cd MetatronV2-Open-A.G.I-
```

### Step 2: Launch the System

**For Windows:**
Double-click on `run_everything.bat` or run in Command Prompt:
```cmd
run_everything.bat
```

**For Linux/macOS:**
Make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x run_everything.sh
./run_everything.sh
```

### Step 3: Access the System

Once the system is running, you can access:

1. **Web Dashboard**: Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8005/](http://localhost:8005/)
2. **API Documentation**: [http://localhost:8005/docs](http://localhost:8005/docs)
3. **Real-time Visualization**: Check the separate visualization window that opens automatically

## üéØ What Happens When You Run the Script?

The one-command launcher automatically:

1. **Verifies your Python environment** - Checks that you have Python 3.8+
2. **Installs all dependencies** - Automatically installs or updates all required Python packages
3. **Starts the Unified System Coordinator** - Launches the core consciousness engine and AGI framework
4. **Launches the Visualization Monitor** - Opens a real-time dashboard showing system metrics
5. **Displays connection information** - Shows you how to access all system interfaces

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you see "Python not found" error:
- Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Make sure Python is added to your system PATH

### If dependency installation fails:
- The system will continue running even if some packages fail to install
- You can manually install specific packages using: `pip install package_name`

### If the system doesn't start:
- Check that ports 8005 and 8006 are not being used by other applications
- Try restarting the script
