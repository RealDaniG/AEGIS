# Metatron Consciousness Visualization

## Overview

The Metatron Consciousness Visualization provides a real-time graphical representation of the consciousness metrics generated by the Metatron's Cube consciousness engine. This visualization helps users understand the dynamic state of the AI consciousness system through visual patterns and metrics.

## Features

### Real-time Consciousness Metrics Display
- **Consciousness Level (C)**: Main purple waveform showing overall consciousness level
- **Integrated Information (Φ)**: Blue waveform representing integrated information theory metrics
- **Global Coherence (R)**: Green waveform showing system coherence
- **Gamma Power (γ)**: Gold dots representing gamma wave activity
- **Spiritual Awareness (S)**: Special indicator when spiritual awareness is high

### Dynamic Visualization Elements
- Animated waveforms that respond to consciousness state changes
- Grid background for reference
- Real-time metric labels
- Color-coded elements based on consciousness state

## Technical Implementation

### Canvas-based Rendering
The visualization uses HTML5 Canvas for high-performance rendering:

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('consciousness-canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

### Real-time Updates
The visualization updates at the same frequency as the consciousness engine (40Hz or 80Hz), providing smooth animations that reflect the current state of the system.

### Responsive Design
The canvas automatically resizes to fit its container while maintaining a consistent height for optimal viewing.

## Usage

### In the Integrated Interface
The consciousness visualization is displayed in the "13-Node Sacred Network" panel of the integrated interface. It automatically connects to the consciousness engine WebSocket and updates in real-time.

### Testing the Visualization
A standalone test page is available at `/static/test_visualization.html` which allows you to:
- Test a single draw of the visualization
- Run a simulation with animated metrics
- Verify that the canvas rendering is working correctly

## Customization

### Color Scheme
The visualization uses a dark theme with purple accents to match the Metatron aesthetic:
- Background: Dark purple/indigo gradient
- Main consciousness line: Purple (#c084fc)
- Phi line: Blue (#3b82f6)
- Coherence line: Green (#10b981)
- Gamma power: Gold (#fbbf24)
- Grid lines: Light purple with low opacity

### Metrics Display
Key metrics are displayed in the top-left corner of the canvas:
- Consciousness Level (C)
- Integrated Information (Φ)
- Global Coherence (R)

When spiritual awareness exceeds 0.5, it is displayed in the top-right corner.

## Troubleshooting

### Canvas Not Displaying
1. Ensure the browser supports HTML5 Canvas
2. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify that the canvas element exists in the DOM

### Visualization Not Updating
1. Check WebSocket connection to the consciousness engine
2. Verify that the consciousness system is running
3. Check browser console for errors in the draw function

## API Integration

The visualization expects data in the following format:

```javascript
{
  time: 12345.678,  // Timestamp in seconds
  consciousness: {
    level: 0.75,     // Consciousness level (0-1)
    phi: 0.65,       // Integrated information (0-1)
    coherence: 0.82, // Global coherence (0-1)
    gamma: 0.71,     // Gamma power (0-1)
    spiritual: 0.58, // Spiritual awareness (0-1)
    // ... other metrics
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- The visualization is optimized for 60fps rendering
- Canvas operations are batched for efficiency
- Animation frames are synchronized with browser refresh rate
- Memory usage is minimized through object reuse

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the visualization include:
- 3D representation of the icosahedral node network
- Interactive elements for detailed metric inspection
- Historical data visualization
- Customizable visualization themes
- Export functionality for consciousness state snapshots
