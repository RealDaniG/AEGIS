# ConscienceAI Auto-Improvement Flow

This document describes the auto-improvement flow for the ConscienceAI system, following a similar approach to KaseMaster's implementation.

## Overview

The auto-improvement flow consists of several interconnected components that work together to continuously enhance the AI system:

1. **Data Ingestion** - Collecting and processing new information
2. **RAG Integration** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for knowledge enhancement
3. **Federated LoRA Training** - Collaborative model improvement
4. **Parameter Optimization** - Automatic tuning of chat parameters
5. **Code Reprogramming** - Automated code analysis and improvement
6. **Observability** - Monitoring and reporting system performance

## Data Ingestion

The system continuously ingests new data from various sources:

### RSS Feed Processing
- Automatic fetching of RSS feeds
- Content extraction and preprocessing
- Storage in structured JSONL format
- Regular updates based on scheduling

### Web Search Integration
- On-demand web search for specific topics
- Content ingestion into the RAG corpus
- Quality filtering and deduplication

### Document Upload
- Support for multiple file formats (.txt, .md, .pdf, .docx)
- Automatic parsing and text extraction
- Integration with RAG system

## RAG Integration

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation system enhances chat responses with relevant context:

### Corpus Management
- TF-IDF based indexing for efficient retrieval
- Metadata preservation for source tracking
- Automatic context selection for user queries

### Context Injection
- Dynamic context selection based on query relevance
- Configurable context length and source count
- Seamless integration with chat models

## Federated LoRA Training

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) enables efficient collaborative model improvement:

### Local Adaptation
- Generation of LoRA adapters from user interactions
- Feedback-based weighting of contributions
- Privacy-preserving local training

### Federated Aggregation
- Secure sharing of adapter weights
- Weighted averaging of multiple adapters
- Integration of improvements into base model

### Contribution Tracking
- Logging of user interactions and feedback
- Quality metrics for contribution scoring
- Reputation system for trusted contributors
