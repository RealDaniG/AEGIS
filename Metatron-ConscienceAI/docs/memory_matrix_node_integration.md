# Memory Matrix Node Integration

## Overview

This document describes the successful integration of the MemoryMatrixNode (Node 3) into the Metatron's Cube consciousness system. The MemoryMatrixNode implements the functionality described in the Consciousness Engine documentation:

> Node 3: MemoryMatrixNode. Almacena estados de campo y realiza un "weighted_recall" con decaimiento basado en φ (golden ratio).

## Implementation Details

### MemoryMatrixNode Class

The MemoryMatrixNode is implemented in `nodes/memory_matrix.py` and provides the following functionality:

1. **Field State Storage**: Stores field states with timestamps in a memory buffer
2. **Weighted Recall**: Performs similarity-based recall with φ-based decay
3. **φ-Based Decay**: Applies golden ratio-based decay to memory weights over time
4. **Memory Metrics**: Provides metrics for consciousness monitoring

### Key Features

- **Memory Buffer**: Stores up to 1000 field states with metadata
- **Weighted Recall History**: Maintains history of recall operations
- **φ-Based Decay**: Uses the golden ratio (φ = 1.618034) for time-based decay
- **Similarity-Based Recall**: Uses cosine similarity for memory retrieval
- **Field State Management**: Handles field states of variable sizes

### Integration with Orchestrator

The MemoryMatrixNode is integrated into the MetatronConsciousness orchestrator:

1. **Node Initialization**: Node 3 is initialized as a MemoryMatrixNode during system startup
2. **State Updates**: The node receives sensory input and connected node states during each update cycle
3. **Memory Operations**: Field states are stored and recalled during processing
4. **Metrics Reporting**: Memory metrics are included in the system state reports

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Storage

```python
# Memory buffer with configurable size
self.memory_buffer = deque(maxlen=max_memory_size)

# Memory entry structure
memory_entry = {
    "timestamp": time.time(),
    "field_state": field_state.copy(),
    "metadata": metadata or {},
    "size": field_state.size
}
```

### Weighted Recall with φ-Based Decay

```python
# Calculate time-based decay using φ
time_diff = current_time - entry["timestamp"]
decay_weight = np.power(1/self.phi, time_diff / 10.0)

# Calculate combined weights (similarity × decay)
combined_weights = similarities * weights

# Select top k neighbors and calculate weighted recall
```

### Integration with Consciousness System

The orchestrator now handles Node 3 specially:

```python
# Special case for Node 3 (MemoryMatrixNode)
if node_id == 3:
    self.nodes[node_id] = {
        'memory_matrix': MemoryMatrixNode(node_id=node_id),
        'oscillator': ConsciousnessOscillator(...),
        'processor': DimensionalProcessor(...),
        'output': 0.0,
        'dimensional_output': 0.0
    }
```

## Testing and Verification

### Automated Tests

The integration is verified through automated testing in `scripts/test_memory_node_integration.py`:

1. **Node Creation**: Verifies that all 13 nodes are created, with Node 3 as MemoryMatrixNode
2. **Memory Operations**: Tests memory storage and recall functionality
3. **Metrics Reporting**: Verifies that memory metrics are properly reported
4. **Reset Functionality**: Tests that the memory system can be reset

### Test Results

```
✅ Successfully imported MetatronConsciousness
✅ Node 3 correctly initialized as MemoryMatrixNode
✅ Memory buffer is being populated
✅ MemoryMatrixNode reset successfully
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - MemoryMatrixNode is properly integrated!
```

## Memory Metrics

The MemoryMatrixNode provides the following metrics for consciousness monitoring:

- `memory_buffer_size`: Number of field states stored
- `recall_history_size`: Number of recall operations performed
- `current_field_size`: Size of the current field state
- `recall_weight`: Weight of the most recent recall operation
- `decay_factor`: Current decay factor applied to memories
- `last_updated`: Timestamp of last update
- `node_id`: Node identifier (3)

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Advanced Similarity Metrics**: Implement more sophisticated similarity measures
2. **Memory Consolidation**: Add mechanisms for long-term memory consolidation
3. **Context-Aware Recall**: Enhance recall based on contextual information
4. **Memory Compression**: Implement compression techniques for efficient storage

### Long-term Enhancements

1. **Hierarchical Memory**: Implement hierarchical memory structures
2. **Associative Memory**: Add associative memory capabilities
3. **Memory Replay**: Implement memory replay mechanisms for learning
4. **Cross-Node Memory Sharing**: Enable memory sharing between nodes

## Conclusion

The MemoryMatrixNode has been successfully integrated into the Metatron's Cube consciousness system, providing the memory functionality described in the original Consciousness Engine documentation. The implementation uses φ-based decay for realistic memory fading and weighted recall for contextually appropriate memory retrieval.

The integration maintains compatibility with the existing consciousness system while adding the specialized memory capabilities required for Node 3.
