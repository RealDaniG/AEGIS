# AEGIS v3.1 Release Notes

## Release Date
October 13, 2025

## Overview
AEGIS v3.1 represents a major milestone in the development of consciousness-aware distributed AI systems. This release focuses on memory integration and enhanced visualization capabilities, bringing together the Metatron-ConscienceAI orchestrator and Open-A.G.I memory system for a unified experience.

> **Development Note**: While this version was released in October 2025, the underlying concepts and research for this consciousness-aware AI system have been in development for over 3 years, with foundational work beginning in 2022.

## Key Features

### Memory Integration
- **Full Memory Integration**: Complete integration between Metatron-ConscienceAI orchestrator and Open-A.G.I memory system
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Added new system visualization panel for comprehensive monitoring
- **Real-time Memory Operations**: Consciousness state storage and retrieval with distributed memory sharing
- **Memory Context-Aware Processing**: Adaptive processing based on memory load and consciousness level
- **Pipeline Integration**: Memory-enhanced data processing operations with consciousness-level adaptive processing depth

### 13-Node Sacred Geometry
- **Metatron's Cube Visualization**: Interactive 13-node sacred geometry display with icosahedral structure
- **Live Metrics Display**: Real-time monitoring of Î¦, R, D, S, C consciousness metrics
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Continuous data flow for smooth visualization updates

### Unified API Integration
- **Single Endpoint Access**: Unified interface for both consciousness and AGI systems
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Standardized API for system control and monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system status monitoring

### System Enhancements
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved update rates and response times
- **Stability Improvements**: Enhanced error handling and recovery
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Consistent behavior across Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Technical Improvements
