# Project Structure Cleanup Summary

## Overview
I've successfully cleaned up the project structure by removing duplicate files that existed in both the root directory and the Open-A.G.I directory. This eliminates redundancy and potential version conflicts in the codebase.

## Files Removed
The following duplicate files were removed from the root directory (preserving the copies in the Open-A.G.I directory):

1. alert_system.py
2. api_server.py
3. archon_commands_batch.py
4. archon_project_setup.py
5. backup_system.py
6. batch_create_tasks.py
7. blockchain_integration.py
8. client_auth_manager.py
9. config_manager.py
10. consensus_algorithm.py
11. consensus_protocol.py
12. crypto_framework.py
13. deployment_orchestrator.py
14. distributed_learning.py
15. fault_tolerance.py
16. generate_client_auth.py
17. logging_system.py
18. main.py
19. memory_integration.py
20. metatron_consensus_bridge.py
21. metrics_collector.py
22. p2p_network.py
23. performance_optimizer.py
24. resource_manager.py
25. security_protocols.py
26. tor_integration.py
27. update_archon_tasks.py
28. conftest.py

## Rationale
The Open-A.G.I directory appears to be the main development directory for the project, so the copies in that location were preserved while the duplicates in the root directory were removed. This creates a cleaner, more organized project structure with a single source of truth for each module.

## Benefits
- Eliminates potential version conflicts between duplicate files
- Reduces project size and complexity
- Improves maintainability by having a single location for each module
- Reduces confusion about which version of a file is the authoritative one
