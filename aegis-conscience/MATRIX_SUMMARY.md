- **Key Features**:
  - Node discovery and registration
  - Automatic connection establishment and maintenance
  - Connection matrix tracking
  - Network topology information
  - Matrix update broadcasting

### 2. Matrix Integration (`main.py`)
- **Purpose**: Integrates matrix management into the main AEGIS node
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic initialization of NodeMatrixManager
  - Periodic matrix updates
  - Matrix data persistence for visualization

### 3. Matrix Visualization Tools (`tools/matrix_visualizer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the connection matrix between nodes
- **Key Features**:
  - Text-based matrix diagram display
  - Connection status legend
  - Detailed node information
  - Network statistics calculation
  - File-based data loading

### 4. Demonstration Scripts
- `matrix_demo.py`: Complete demonstration of matrix connectivity

- Detailed node information including connection counts and percentages
- Network statistics including connectivity percentage and node rankings

### Data Persistence
- Automatic saving of matrix data for visualization
- JSON format for easy integration with other tools
- Example data generation for testing and demonstration

### Monitoring and Testing
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Error handling and logging

## How to Use
