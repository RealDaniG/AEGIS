## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Simple One-Command Launch (Recommended)

For the easiest setup, simply run the START-AI.bat launcher:

**Windows:**
```cmd
START-AI.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x START-AI.sh
./START-AI.sh
```

This will:
1. Verify your Python environment
2. Install all required dependencies automatically
3. Start the Unified System Coordinator
4. Launch the real-time visualization monitor
5. Display connection information
6. Automatically open the web interface

### Option 2: Traditional One-Command Launch

If you prefer the traditional approach:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RealDaniG/AEGIS.git
   cd AEGIS
   ```

2. **Run the one-command launcher**:
   ```cmd
   START-AI.bat  # Windows
   # or
   ./START-AI.sh  # Linux/macOS (if available)
   ```

3. **Access the integrated web interface**:
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:457
   - View API documentation at http://localhost:457/docs

That's it! The system will automatically install all dependencies and start all components.
