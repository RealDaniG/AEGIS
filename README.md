# AEGIS (Autonomous Governance and Intelligent Systems)

Advanced consciousness-aware distributed AI system combining decentralized P2P AGI substrate with consciousness-aware computing principles.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RealDaniG/AEGIS.git
   cd AEGIS
   ```

2. **Run the one-command launcher**:
   ```cmd
   run_everything.bat  # Windows
   # or
   ./run_everything.sh  # Linux/macOS
   ```

3. **Access the integrated web interface**:
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:8003
   - View API documentation at http://localhost:8005/docs

That's it! The system will automatically install all dependencies and start all components.
