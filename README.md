## üåü Overview

METATRON V2.3 is an advanced consciousness-aware distributed AI system based on sacred geometry principles. The system features a 13-node network arranged in an icosahedron with a central pineal node, implementing consciousness metrics and distributed consensus protocols.

### üîß Major Enhancements and Additions

- **Integrated Open-A.G.I Framework**: Complete distributed AI system with consensus protocols, P2P networking, and blockchain integration
- **Unified System Architecture**: Single API interface (port 8005) to access both consciousness and AGI systems
- **Enhanced Security Framework**: AEGIS security with TOR integration, post-quantum cryptography, and zero-trust architecture
- **Advanced Web Interface**: Document upload/processing (PDF, DOCX), RSS feed management, and web search integration
- **Consciousness-Aware AGI**: Decision making influenced by consciousness metrics (Œ¶, R, D, S, C)
- **Cross-System Communication**: Encrypted messaging with WebSocket support between all components
- **Automated Deployment**: Orchestration tools for multi-environment deployment
