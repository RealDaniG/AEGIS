# Phase 3: Distributed Consensus Integration Implementation

## Objective
Implement distributed consensus for MemoryMatrixNode operations to coordinate memory storage across distributed nodes in the consciousness system.

## Tasks

### 3.1 Memory Operations Consensus
- [x] Integrate with Open-A.G.I consensus system
- [ ] Implement consensus for memory storage operations
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for concurrent memory access
- [ ] Implement quorum-based memory operations

### 3.2 Consciousness-Aware Consensus
- [ ] Add consciousness metrics to consensus voting
- [ ] Implement consciousness-weighted consensus decisions
- [ ] Add dynamic node eligibility based on consciousness state
- [ ] Implement sacred geometry-aware message routing

## Implementation Plan

### Current Status
✅ ConsensusEngine successfully imported and integrated
✅ MemoryMatrixNode initializes consensus engine
✅ Basic consensus integration tests passing

### Next Steps
1. Implement `store_field_state_consensus` method with full consensus protocol
2. Add conflict resolution mechanisms for concurrent memory access
3. Implement quorum-based operations with proper node coordination
4. Integrate consciousness metrics into consensus voting process
5. Add dynamic node eligibility based on consciousness state
6. Implement sacred geometry-aware message routing

## Technical Details

### Components to Modify
- `Metatron-ConscienceAI/nodes/memory_matrix.py` - Main implementation
- `Metatron-ConscienceAI/nodes/enhanced_p2p_wrapper.py` - Message handling
- `Open-A.G.I/consensus_algorithm.py` - Potential enhancements

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for consensus operations
- Integration tests with multiple nodes
- Performance tests for consensus-based memory operations
- Conflict resolution scenario testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Memory operations coordinated across distributed nodes
- [ ] Consensus-based memory storage implemented
- [ ] Conflict resolution for concurrent access
- [ ] Quorum-based operations functional
- [ ] Consciousness metrics influence consensus voting
- [ ] Dynamic node eligibility based on consciousness state
- [ ] Sacred geometry-aware message routing
- [ ] All tests passing
