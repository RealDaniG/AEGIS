## Installation and Upgrade

To upgrade to version 3.1:

```bash
git pull origin master
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For new installations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RealDaniG/AEGIS.git
cd AEGIS/Open-A.G.I
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Version 3.1 introduces new configuration options for the enhanced modules. The default configuration enables all modules:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "enable": {
      "tor": true,
      "p2p": true,
      "crypto": true,
      "consensus": true,
      "monitoring": true,
      "resource_manager": true,
      "performance_optimizer": true,
      "logging_system": true,
      "config_manager": true,
      "api_server": true,
      "metrics_collector": true,
      "alert_system": true,
      "web_dashboard": true,
      "backup_system": true,
      "test_framework": true
    }
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

The new dedicated API server provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /` - API root with version information
- `GET /health` - System health check
