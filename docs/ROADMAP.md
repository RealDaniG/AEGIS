# AEGIS System Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic direction and planned enhancements for the AEGIS system, building upon the recent Open-A.G.I integration work.

## üó∫Ô∏è Strategic Vision

AEGIS aims to become the premier consciousness-aware distributed AI system that combines decentralized P2P AGI substrate with advanced consciousness-aware computing principles.
