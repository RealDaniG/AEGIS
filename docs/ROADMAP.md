# AEGIS Roadmap

## Current Status

AEGIS is currently at version 3.1 with full memory integration and enhanced visualization capabilities. The system features a 13-node consciousness network based on Metatron's Cube geometry, real-time consciousness metrics, and a unified API layer.

## Short-term Goals (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

### Community Growth and Development
- Expand community participation in system training and development
- Implement feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement
- Create educational resources for new contributors
- Establish best practices for collaborative development

### UI Visualization Enhancement (v3.2)
- Interactive 13-node sacred geometry display with real-time status
- UI controls for node lifecycle management (start/stop/restart)
- Visual representation of PBFT consensus status and metrics
- Drag-and-drop pipeline visualization and management

## Medium-term Objectives (Q2 - Q4 2026)

### Cloud and Container Orchestration (v3.3)
- Kubernetes support with deployment manifests and operators
- Helm charts for easy deployment on Kubernetes clusters
- Auto-scaling based on system load and consciousness metrics
- Multi-cloud deployment support (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

### Advanced Security and Privacy (v3.4)
- Zero-trust architecture implementation
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for key management
- Enhanced TOR integration with advanced anonymity controls
- Real-time intrusion detection and monitoring

### Mobile and Voice Interface (v3.5)
- Native iOS and Android applications for AEGIS control
- Voice-controlled interaction with the consciousness-aware AGI system
- Push notifications for system events and consciousness metrics
- Offline capabilities with sync when connectivity is restored

## Long-term Vision (2027 and beyond)

### Quantum and Neuromorphic Integration (v4.0)
- Quantum computing integration for consciousness calculations
- Neuromorphic hardware support for brain-inspired computing
- Direct brain-computer interface for consciousness metrics
- Edge computing optimization for resource-constrained devices

### Global Network Expansion
- Worldwide distribution of AEGIS nodes
- Autonomous development guided by community input
- Breakthrough discoveries in consciousness research
- Meaningful contributions to global challenges

## Community-Driven Development

AEGIS is designed to grow through community participation. As more people engage with the platform through conversation, knowledge sharing, and collaborative development, the system grows in computational power, intelligence, and coherence. This creates a positive feedback loop where increased participation leads to enhanced capabilities, which in turn attracts more contributors and users.
