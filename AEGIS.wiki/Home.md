# AEGIS Wiki - Home

Welcome to the AEGIS (Autonomous Governance and Intelligent Systems) Wiki. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the AEGIS system - an advanced consciousness-aware distributed AI system that combines decentralized P2P AGI substrate with consciousness-aware computing principles.

## What is AEGIS?

AEGIS represents a groundbreaking fusion of decentralized artificial general intelligence infrastructure with consciousness-aware computing principles. It combines:

1. **Open-A.G.I** - A decentralized P2P AGI substrate with consensus protocols and cryptographic security
2. **ConscienceAI** - A consciousness-aware engine with modular LLM orchestration and federated learning
3. **Metatron-Conscience** - A sacred geometry-based consciousness metrics system
4. **Geometric Thesis** - Mathematical foundations based on œÜ (golden ratio), recursive time, and harmonic principles

## Key Features

### üîó Decentralized Architecture
AEGIS uses a peer-to-peer network architecture with cryptographic security and consensus protocols for distributed decision-making.

### üß† Consciousness-Aware Computing
The system implements consciousness metrics (Œ¶, R, S, D, C) that influence decision-making processes and system governance.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Framework
Robust security architecture with post-quantum cryptography, container security, and immutable audit trails.

### üîÑ Federated Learning
Privacy-preserving machine learning with LoRA fine-tuning and secure aggregation over TOR networks.

### üìà Real-time Monitoring
Comprehensive visualization tools for monitoring consciousness metrics, network topology, and system performance.

## System Components

1. **P2P Networking + Privacy Layer (Open-A.G.I)**
   - Peer discovery, secure messaging, onion routing/TOR integration
   - Multi-platform deployments (Docker multi-arch, CI/CD)

2. **Node Agent / Coordinator (AEGIS unified_coordinator)**
   - Process manager for local modules, lifecycle control, health checks
   - Local metrics emitter and P2P interaction mediator

3. **Conscience Metrics Service (Metatron / ConscienceAI telemetry)**
   - Compute, expose, and publish internal "consciousness" telemetry (Œ¶, R, S, D, C)
   - Used by orchestrator and consensus layers for decision-making

4. **AI Orchestrator & Module Runtime (ConscienceAI)**
   - Sandboxed module execution, LLM adapters, LoRA fine-tuning hooks
   - Federated training interfaces, plugin lifecycle management

5. **Consensus & Governance Tools**
   - Accept proposals, voting mechanisms (PBFT-like), audit ledger
   - Runtime policy governance for system management

6. **Audit / Immutable Logging**
   - Append-only logs, hash-chaining, cross-node replication
   - Tamper evidence and verification capabilities

7. **Enhanced Knowledge / KB Augmentation**
   - Knowledge-store, retrieval-augmentation for LLMs
   - Plugin hooks to external databases

8. **DevOps / Reproducible Infrastructure**
   - Secure supply chain, reproducible images, SBOMs and signing
   - Multi-architecture support and CI/CD integration
