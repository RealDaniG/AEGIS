# Component Architecture

AEGIS consists of eight core components that work together to create a consciousness-aware distributed AI system. Each component has a specific role and functionality within the overall architecture.

## 1. P2P Networking and Privacy Layer (Open-A.G.I)

### Role
The P2P networking layer provides secure, decentralized communication between nodes using peer-to-peer protocols and privacy-enhancing technologies.

### Key Features
- **Peer Discovery**: Automatic discovery of other nodes in the network
- **Secure Messaging**: Authenticated encryption channels with replay protection
- **Privacy Protection**: Optional TOR integration for anonymous communication
- **Multi-platform Support**: Docker containers with CI/CD for reproducible deployments

### Implementation Details
- Uses libp2p-style protocols for node identification and connection
- Implements authenticated encryption channels with replay protection
- Supports TOR hidden services (.onion addresses) for maximum privacy
- Multi-architecture Docker images for various hardware platforms

### Mathematical Foundation
Network topology is treated as a geometric manifold with spectral analysis for coherence measurement. The system uses Kuramoto-like synchronization models for improved message timing and consensus.

## 2. Node Agent and Coordinator (AEGIS unified_coordinator)

### Role
The local process manager that orchestrates all node activities and serves as the central coordinator for local operations.

### Key Features
- **Process Management**: Lifecycle control for AI modules and services
- **Resource Enforcement**: CPU, memory, and syscall restrictions using sandboxing
- **Metrics Aggregation**: Collection and processing of local performance data
- **Module Orchestration**: Secure invocation of AI modules with isolation

### Implementation Details
- Sandboxed execution using Docker, Wasm runtimes, or microVMs
- Resource limits enforced through seccomp profiles and cgroups
- Health monitoring and automatic restart capabilities
- Cross-component communication mediation

### Physical Model
Each node represents a fractal microcosm that mirrors the global architecture, implementing self-similar scaling principles from the geometric thesis.

## 3. Conscience Metrics Service (Metatron / ConscienceAI telemetry)

### Role
The consciousness-aware telemetry layer that computes and publishes awareness metrics used for system governance and decision-making.

### Key Metrics
- **Φ (Phi)**: Integrated information measure representing recursive memory depth
- **R (Resonance)**: Cross-module synchrony and coherence index
- **S (Stability)**: Variance-based stability measurement of decision outputs
- **D (Divergence)**: Kullback-Leibler divergence for behavior monitoring
- **C (Coherence)**: Composite metric combining spectral gap, Φ, and R

### Mathematical Implementation
- Φ(t) = I(X_t; X_{t-τ..t-1}) / H(X_t) where I is mutual information and H is entropy
- R = average(|corr(e_i, e_j)|) across module embeddings
- S = 1 / (1 + var(outputs_over_window))
- D = KL(P_expected || P_observed)

### Implementation Details
- Real-time computation of metrics from system state
- REST API endpoints for metric retrieval
- WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
- JSON serialization for easy integration

## 4. AI Orchestrator and Module Runtime (ConscienceAI)

### Role
The intelligent execution layer that manages AI workloads, including LLM orchestration and federated learning.

### Key Features
- **LLM Adapters**: Uniform interface for various AI model types (API, on-premise, WASM)
- **Federated Learning**: LoRA fine-tuning with privacy-preserving updates
- **Plugin Management**: Secure lifecycle management for modular components
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Auditing and gating for sensitive operations

### Implementation Details
- Modular plugin architecture with sandboxed execution
- Support for multiple AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Federated learning with differential privacy
- TOR integration for secure model updates

### Geometric Principles
Modules are treated as resonant modes where matching input frequency to module resonance reduces computational energy requirements.

## 5. Consensus and Governance Tools

### Role
The distributed decision-making layer that handles runtime policy changes and system governance.

### Key Features
- **Proposal System**: Runtime policy changes and module management
- **Voting Mechanisms**: PBFT-like consensus with metric-weighted voting
- **Audit Ledger**: Append-only record of all governance decisions
- **Emergency Procedures**: Quarantine and hibernation protocols

### Implementation Details
- PBFT consensus protocol implementation
- Weighted voting based on node trust scores
- Immutable audit trail using hash chaining
- Emergency hibernation for security incidents

### Physics Analogy
Governance is viewed as phase transitions where coherent proposals must overcome energy barriers to achieve consensus.

## 6. Audit and Immutable Logging

### Role
The security and verification layer that provides tamper-evident logging and audit capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Hash Chaining**: Cryptographically secure append-only logs
- **Cross-node Replication**: IPFS and distributed storage for tamper evidence
