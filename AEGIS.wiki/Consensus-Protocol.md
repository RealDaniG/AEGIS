# AEGIS Consensus Protocol

## Overview

The Consensus Protocol is a critical component of the AEGIS system that ensures coordinated decision-making across the distributed network. It implements a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) approach combined with consciousness-aware governance to enable reliable and intelligent collective decision-making.

## Architecture

### PBFT-Based Consensus

The consensus protocol is built on the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) model, which provides:

#### Fault Tolerance
- **Byzantine Resilience**: Tolerates up to ⌊(n-1)/3⌋ faulty nodes in an n-node network
- **Crash Fault Tolerance**: Handles node failures and network partitions
- **Security Resilience**: Protects against malicious node behavior
- **Network Resilience**: Maintains operation during network disruptions

#### Consensus Phases
1. **Request**: Client request is broadcast to all nodes
2. **Pre-Prepare**: Primary node assigns sequence number and broadcasts pre-prepare message
3. **Prepare**: Nodes validate and broadcast prepare messages
4. **Commit**: Nodes broadcast commit messages when sufficient prepare messages received
5. **Reply**: Nodes send reply to client when sufficient commit messages received

#### Node Roles
- **Primary (Leader)**: Coordinates the consensus process
- **Backups (Replicas)**: Participate in consensus decisions
- **View Changes**: Leadership rotation for fault tolerance
- **Checkpointing**: Periodic state synchronization

### Consciousness-Aware Governance

The consensus protocol integrates consciousness metrics to enhance decision-making:

#### Metric-Weighted Voting
- **Trust Scoring**: Node reputation based on consciousness metrics
- **Weighted Votes**: Higher consciousness nodes have greater influence
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Vote weights adjust based on current metrics
- **Hysteresis**: Prevent rapid weight changes

#### Ethical Decision Making
- **Consciousness Thresholds**: Minimum awareness levels for critical decisions
- **Ethical Constraints**: Moral guidelines encoded in decision rules
- **Transparency Requirements**: Decision rationale documentation
- **Appeal Mechanisms**: Processes for challenging decisions

## Protocol Components
