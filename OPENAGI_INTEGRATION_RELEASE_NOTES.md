- Supports both Open-A.G.I and AEGIS deployment mechanisms with fallbacks

### 2. TOR Integration
- **TOR Adapter** (`cross_system_comm/tor_adapter.py`): Integrates Open-A.G.I's TOR integration with AEGIS communication systems
- Manages onion service creation, TOR network status, and security levels
- Provides circuit rotation and anonymity controls

### 3. Metrics and Monitoring
- **Metrics Bridge** (`visualization_tools/metrics_bridge.py`): Bridges Open-A.G.I monitoring with AEGIS visualization tools
- Collects system, network, performance, and consciousness metrics
- Supports WebSocket broadcasting and Prometheus export

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Multi-OS testing matrix with Python versions 3.9-3.11
- Docker multi-arch builds (AMD64, ARM64)
- SBOM generation and image signing with cosign
- Deployment validation

### 5. Containerization
- **Docker Configuration** (`deploy/Dockerfile`): Multi-stage build process with security hardening
- Non-root user execution and health checks
- Environment variable standardization

### 6. Development Environment
- **Docker Compose** (`deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml`): Complete development environment with:
  - Metatron main node
  - Worker nodes (configurable)
  - TOR proxy service
  - Redis for caching
  - Prometheus for metrics
  - Grafana for visualization
  - ELK stack for logging
  - n8n for workflow automation

### 7. Documentation
- **Integration Guide** (`docs/openagi_integration_guide.md`): Comprehensive guide for using the integration
- **Deployment Manifest** (`AEGIS_OPENAGI_DEPLOY_MANIFEST.md`): Detailed mapping of components
- **Integration Summary** (`AEGIS_OPENAGI_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`): Executive overview
