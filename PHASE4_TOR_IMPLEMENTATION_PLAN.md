# Phase 4: TOR Integration Implementation

## Objective
Enable anonymous communication for MemoryMatrixNode operations through TOR integration to enhance privacy and security of memory sharing.

## Tasks

### 4.1 Anonymous Memory Sharing
- [x] Integrate with Open-A.G.I TOR gateway
- [ ] Implement onion routing for memory data
- [ ] Add anonymous peer discovery
- [ ] Implement privacy-preserving memory sharing

## Implementation Plan

### Current Status
✅ TorGateway successfully imported and integrated
✅ MemoryMatrixNode can initialize TOR gateway
✅ Basic TOR integration tests passing

### Next Steps
1. Implement onion routing for memory data transmission
2. Add anonymous peer discovery mechanisms
3. Implement privacy-preserving memory sharing protocols
4. Integrate TOR with existing P2P network functionality
5. Add TOR-specific message handlers in EnhancedP2PWrapper
6. Implement TOR circuit management for memory operations

## Technical Details

### Components to Modify
- `Metatron-ConscienceAI/nodes/memory_matrix.py` - Main implementation
- `Metatron-ConscienceAI/nodes/enhanced_p2p_wrapper.py` - TOR message handling
- `Open-A.G.I/tor_integration.py` - Potential enhancements

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for TOR operations
- Integration tests with TOR network
- Privacy and anonymity verification tests
- Performance tests for TOR-based memory operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TOR integration with Open-A.G.I gateway
- [ ] Onion routing for memory data implemented
- [ ] Anonymous peer discovery functional
- [ ] Privacy-preserving memory sharing operational
- [ ] All tests passing
