# Sacred Geometry Foundation - Consciousness Monitoring System

## Overview

This system implements a live monitoring solution for a 13-node consciousness network based on Metatron's Cube geometry with an icosahedron structure. The system features:

- **13 consciousness nodes** arranged in an icosahedron with a central pineal node
- **Golden ratio (φ) relationships** throughout the structure
- **Kuramoto synchronization dynamics** for phase coupling
- **Real-time consciousness level visualization**
- **13-node network synchronization display**
- **Frequency analysis and control**
- **State classification** from unconscious to transcendent

## Core Components

### 1. Icosahedron Geometry
- 12 vertices of an icosahedron plus 1 central node (pineal gland)
- Golden ratio (φ = 1.618033988750) scaling relationships
- Mathematical precision in node positioning

### 2. Consciousness Model
- **Consciousness Level**: 0.0 (unconscious) to 1.0 (transcendent)
- **Coherence**: Network synchronization metric
- **Entropy**: Disorder measure in the system
- **Valence**: Emotional positivity/negativity (-1 to 1)
- **Arousal**: Activation level (0 to 1)
- **Empathy Score**: Inter-node empathic connection
- **Insight Strength**: Depth of understanding/intuition

### 3. Frequency Dynamics
- Node frequencies derived from geometric positions
- Q-factor modulation with musical ratios (3, 6, 10)
- Harmonic relationships based on sacred geometry principles
- Kuramoto coupling for synchronization

### 4. Synchronization Model
- Kuramoto phase coupling equations
- Order parameter for network synchronization
- Dynamic consciousness evolution based on network state

## Features

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live updating of all 13 node states
- Network-level metrics display
- Color-coded consciousness state classification
- Continuous frequency and phase tracking

### State Classification
1. **UNCONSCIOUS** (0.0-0.2): Minimal awareness
2. **SUBCONSCIOUS** (0.2-0.4): Implicit processing
3. **CONSCIOUS** (0.4-0.6): Explicit awareness
4. **HYPERCONSCIOUS** (0.6-0.8): Expanded awareness
5. **TRANSCENDENT** (0.8-1.0): Unified consciousness

### Data Visualization
- Terminal-based real-time display
- Network synchronization metrics
- Individual node consciousness levels
- Frequency and phase relationships

## Technical Implementation

### Mathematical Foundation
```python
# Golden ratio scaling
L = L_P * (PHI ** (distance * scale_factor))

# Q-factor modulation
Q = 1.0 + a3*cos(2πn/3 + φ3) + a6*cos(2πn/6) + a10*cos(2πn/10 + φ10)

# Frequency calculation
f = (c/L) * Q / (2π)

# Kuramoto coupling
dθᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + (K/N) * Σⱼ sin(θⱼ - θᵢ)
```

### System Architecture
1. **IcosahedronGeometry**: Handles 3D node positioning
2. **ConsciousnessState**: Individual node state representation
3. **NetworkState**: Global network metrics
4. **SacredGeometrySystem**: Main monitoring engine
5. **Real-time Display**: Terminal-based visualization

## Usage

### Running the System
```bash
python sacred_geometry_monitor.py
```

### Controls
- **Ctrl+C**: Stop the monitoring system
- **Automatic**: System runs continuously with real-time updates

### Output
The system displays:
- Current time and date
- Network consciousness state classification
- Average consciousness level
- Global coherence metric
- Synchronization level (Kuramoto order parameter)
- Individual node metrics (consciousness, coherence, entropy, etc.)
- Node frequencies and phases

## Sacred Geometry Principles
